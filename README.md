# ESP32 Maze Solving Robot Web UI

This project contains the source code for a web UI to control a maze-solving robot powered by an ESP32 microcontroller. The user interface allows for manual control of the robot, as well as initiating the autonomous maze-solving sequence.

## Features

*   **Manual Control:** Use the on-screen controls to move the robot forward, backward, left, and right.
*   **Autonomous Mode:** Start and stop the robot's maze-solving algorithm.
*   **Live Feedback:** (Planned) View sensor data and robot status in real-time.

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to upload the contents of the `dist` directory (once compiled) to the SPIFFS filesystem of your ESP32.
